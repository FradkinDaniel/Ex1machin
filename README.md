## About
This project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course.  
The assignment focuses on implementing and testing a **linear regression model** with gradient descent.

It demonstrates:
- Loading and visualizing data  
- Implementing linear regression with cost function minimization  
- Training with **gradient descent**  
- Plotting the regression line and cost convergence  

---

## Model
The linear regression hypothesis is:

\[
h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x
\]

Training is performed using **gradient descent** to minimize the cost function:

\[
J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right)^2
\]

## Dataset
The dataset (e.g. `ex1data1.txt`) contains two columns:
- `x`: independent variable (feature)  
- `y`: dependent variable (target value)  

It is used to train the linear regression model and visualize the regression line.

## Getting Started
